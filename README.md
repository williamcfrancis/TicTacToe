# TicTacToe
Tic-Tac-Toe game with Single-player and Multi-player modes in Turbo C++. Computer always wins or settles in a draw in Single-player mode. Applied File concepts to store and manipulate player history. Graphic-rich interface. Complete code written by me as a hobby-cum-project after high school.
